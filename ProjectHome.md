**Livepress History Lesson:**

Livepress was originally written by Jason Goldsmith (Aka: "unteins") back in 2005.  He maintained the plugin up until 2006.  His last updated version of the plugin, I believe, was 1.99.

When the plugin ceased to work with newer releases of Wordpress in 2006, it was kept working by "CreepiGurl".  The last known version of the plugin was 1.99.9, made available in 2006.  Later, information on how to hack the plugin to get it working with WP version 2.2, sometime in 2007, could be found on her site.

Fast forward to 2008: As a fan of the original plugin, I have kept a personal copy updated with changes I wanted and needed.  So with this new project, I hope to keep the plugin alive.   (Because I really don't like the alternatives!)
